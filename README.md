# Needed

A Productivity app that allows you to schedule tasks, events, and make notes. Written in Java, Kotlin using Android Studio. We wanted to develop an application that had a Kanban board to keep a tab on tasks, and make it so that one can also make notes and schedule calendar events on it.

## Task View

The task view is very simple, it allows the user to plan their tasks using 'to-do', 'doing', and 'done' queues.

## Notes View

This view allows the user to add, edit, and delete notes

This view allows the user to add events to their calendar.
